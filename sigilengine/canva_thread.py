    Canvas Thread that manages its own state, rendering, and message forwarding.

        Main thread loop that processes the command queue.
        
        This method initializes the canvas, registers it in SPACE,
        and then enters a processing loop where it:
        1. Waits for commands on the queue
        2. Processes each command via parse_packet
        3. Continues until killed or marked as not alive
        4. Cleans up by removing itself from SPACE
        
        All canvas threads have this as their entry point.
