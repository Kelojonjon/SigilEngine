Below are all the modules provided in the project:
1. **SPACE** is a library where all canvas threads keep their registries.  
   Canvases register their queues and buffers here for easy interaction.

2. **ASCII_SCREEN** is a class of reusable, stateless static methods used across the modules.

3. **CANVA_THREAD** is a writable buffer that can perform various tasks on its buffer.  
   Most of the ASCII_SCREEN tools are designed to modify the state of this class.

4. **PACKET_CREATOR** is a simple API that allows interaction with canvases through simple commands.  
   Requests are validated and returned as ready-to-send packets for the CANVA_THREAD parser.
