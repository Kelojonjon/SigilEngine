ðŸš€ Logger Plan Overview

Flow:
Canvas â†’ logger.log(level, message + metadata) â†’ handler.emit(record) â†’ prebuffer (batch size N) â†’ central queue â†’ filtering â†’ storage â†’ file tailing

Components:
- Canvas logger:
    - logger = logging.getLogger(canvas_id)
    - registers itself into logger space (shared registry)
    - logging is auto-enabled when a logger is registered; 
      if no logger is registered, logging is effectively disabled
    - adds metadata: owner, canvas_id
    - batches messages into prebuffer to reduce spam

- Custom handler:
    - MyMonsterHandler
    - receives record â†’ pushes into prebuffer

- Prebuffer:
    - holds raw records temporarily
    - batch size configurable (e.g., 10 messages)
    - flushes batch into central queue

- Central handler:
    - reads from central queue
    - applies:
        - per-level discard / sample rules (info, warning, error)
    - manages:
        - max buffer size
        - file write frequency
        - file rotation (max file size, retention count)
    - **no live render pipeline â€” file tailing only**

- Storage:
    - writes logs to file every X messages or seconds
    - rotates file when max size is reached

- File tailing:
    - users can monitor logs with external tools (e.g., `tail -f log.txt`)
    - supports filtering on canvas_id, owner (via log metadata)

Control options:
- Enable/disable logging dynamically (via logger space presence)
- Per-level sample rates
- Max queue / buffer sizes
- Max log file size & rotation count

âœ¨ Notes:
- Canvas â†’ minimal logic: batching + metadata only
- Prebuffer â†’ smooths bursts, sends batches to central queue
- Central handler â†’ handles filtering, rotation, file writing
- External tailing â†’ live monitoring via file tools only
